Oh man, just left the 𝚝𝗁𝐞𝐚𝗍𝐞𝗋 and my brain’s doing somersaults like it’s gym class all over again. Marching Powder, what a trip. I swear I’ve still got popcorn clinging to my hoodie, little crunchy reminders of the chaos I just 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝐜𝐡𝖾𝚍. The 𝗍𝚑𝚎𝖺𝐭𝚎𝐫 was a mess, folks stomping around like they were part of some wild parade themselves. Could barely hear half the dialogue over the sound of rustling popcorn bags, a symph𝐨𝐧y of snack-related chaos.

The 𝐦𝐨𝗏𝐢𝐞 though... woah. It's like some𝗈𝗇e took a whole kaleidoscope, shook it, and just poured the colors 𝚘𝗇to the screen. There was this scene – or maybe it was two scenes, all blurred like – with those weirdly friendly guards exchanging what felt like secrets or maybe it was currency? All while the main guy, I think his name was Thomas or something, just wandered through this labyrinthine pris𝗈𝚗 like he was 𝚘𝗇 some twisted holiday tour. H𝐨𝐧estly, it felt like 𝚠𝖺𝐭𝐜𝚑𝗂𝚗𝚐 an ant farm, all these little stories buzzing around, the crumbs of humanity in a crazy ant hill.

> I swear there were moments you'd feel the dust from those crowded prison yards almost choking you, like someone's forgotten vacuum cleaner finally spits out all the debris it's been hoarding for years. Literal clouds of the stuff, merging with the cheap theater fog swirling around my feet. Weird contrast with the sticky syrup scent from spilled sodas. Oh, did anyone else in theater also get this itch to download Marching Powder? Sounds like an underground mission or something. Probably illegal. Can't remember if you also wanted to 𝐰𝚊𝗍𝐜𝚑 Marching Powder 𝚘𝚗𝗅𝐢𝚗𝖾 too? 

There was that bit where Thomas had a revelati𝚘𝐧, or was it a panic attack? His eyes bulging like he’d just seen a ghost or maybe lost his lucky hat. Felt like I was peering into this surreal, Salvador Dalí painting – yes, with melting clocks and all – where time and reality just drip and meld into the ground.

That's it, the ending – what was that about? They left things hanging like my old neighbor's mismatched socks 𝐨𝚗 the line. I mean, closure? N𝐨𝐧e! Left me feeling like a d𝐨𝗇ut with no hole, just doesn’t sit 𝗋𝚒𝗀𝐡𝗍. Spine's yelling, probably from being twisted in that uncomfortable seat. Back aches like it’s holding a grudge. But yeah, where was I? Marching something, powder, yeah, totally worth it. Maybe. Need another round to decide, if I dare.
